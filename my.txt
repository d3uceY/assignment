things that happen when you type a web address in your browser

1. the browser goes to the Dns server and finds the real address of the server that the websites live on 
2. the browser sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the websites to the client 
3. if the server approve the client's request the server sends the client "200K message'
4. the browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you

when browsers send requests to servers for HTML files often contain <link> elements
